This project allows you to manage events and register guests. It is split into two projects. The backend is implemented using https://nestjs.com/[NestJS] and Typescript. The frontend uses https://nextjs.org/[NextJS] and https://mui.com/[Material UI]. This project contains a page where users can enter new events and also add visitors. When a new visitor is added, a unique barcode is generated. This can then be sent to the visitor.

== Get started

The following programmes are required to start the project:

* https://nodejs.org/en[NodeJs (20.x)]

After this, any necessary dependencies can be installed using the `pnpm install` command. Once all dependencies have been successfully installed and downloaded, the applications can be started using the `pnpm start` command.
